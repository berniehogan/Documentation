Thank you for your interest in the Network Canvas project! 

We hope that over the coming weeks and months this website will develop into a one-stop resource for any and all information relating to using this software.

For the time being we have posted an installation guide for the software, and will shortly be adding materials for our workshop at Sunbelt 2019 in Montreal. If you are a participant at this workshop, check back closer to the time to find more articles and resources. We look forward to meeting you!
