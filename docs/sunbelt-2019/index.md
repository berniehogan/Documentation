1. Let them know the software is available to download, should be downloaded before the workshop (_send our installation guide_), and to please email us if there are any issues
2. Ask them to share with us their goals for the workshop and a brief description of how they might want to use Network Canvas
3. Ask participants to bring a research instrument with them, as we will discuss how we might be able to translate their protocol into Network Canvas within the afternoon session.
