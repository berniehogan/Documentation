### Server and Network Canvas Workflows


## NOTE: Bernie is working on this section offline as of 13:00BST / 8:00EDT. 

Part I: 30 minutes before the lunch break. 

Part II: 1 hour after the break

Learning Goals: 



*   How to get a protocol into Network Canvas via Server
*   Getting to know the project management features of Server 
*   Know when to use Server versus when to use a file
*   Getting data into Server from Network Canvas 
*   Exporting collated data from Server for further analysis 


#### Roster Demonstration Study Using Sunbelt Networks: 

We want you to open this next protocol on your own machine.** **To do this, we need to talk about importing interview protocols into your study devices.

Protocol Outline.



*   Name Generator Side Panel 
    *   Shows SNA Journals and asks which participant has published in
    *   Ability to drag from side panel or create new
    *   Maybe names will be too long?
    *   Alternative ideas for NG side panel?
*   Small Roster Interface  
    *   Workshop attendees asked to select themselves. Filter and Sort options (Name, last name, institution).
    *   IMPORTANT: this must create a different node type so as not to show on the later sociogram.
*   Large Roster : Built using the participant attendance list for the workshop.
    *   Shows the auto complete for this years Sunbelt attendees. 
    *   “People you knew before the conference”
*   Use ego form interface for nominating other sunbelt conferences the participant has attended
    *   Which of the following Sunbelt conferences have you also attended? Categorical multiselect with Checkbox group component.
*   Sociogram layout step. 
    *   Lay out nodes from large roster
    *   Use nomination for having published with.
    *   Use alter alter links for “believe these people have published together without me”.

This morning you imported a survey into Network Canvas as a file. This is fine if you are only using one device and want to export the data from each interview individually. However, in many cases, you will want to manage a number of cases collectively and you will want to use a number of devices to capture that data. 

We are first going to show you how to pair Network Canvas with the study you just created. Then after the break we will all pair with a single instance of Server that we are running. Using that instance, we will all be able to download the same protocol, run an interview (using ourselves as participants), and then upload all of the cases to Server 


#### How to get a protocol into Network Canvas via Server

Let’s begin by opening up the Server application on your own computer. 



<p id="gdcalert38" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/2019-Sunbelt37.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert39">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/2019-Sunbelt37.png "image_tooltip")


Add the protocol that we have just created. It will appear on the side and we can also see some important details like number of interviews done, settings, and some details about the interviews as a summary. 

Now that the protocol is imported, we can then pair Server with our field devices, which in this case refers to the version of Network Canvas running on your computer. Go to Network Canvas and tap the ‘Add New Protocol’ button in the lower right hand corner. 



<p id="gdcalert39" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/2019-Sunbelt38.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert40">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/2019-Sunbelt38.png "image_tooltip")


Where before we imported a protocol from a URL, this time we will pair Server and Network Canvas. When you select the “From Server” tab it should find the Server on your local computer. It will not be paired yet. You should be able to see the server icon like so: 



<p id="gdcalert40" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/2019-Sunbelt39.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert41">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/2019-Sunbelt39.png "image_tooltip")


From here, tap on the Server icon.

Troubleshooting: 



*   If you do not see a Server icon, there might be something on your local network / VPN / wifi that is blocking the program from discovering the Server. 
    *   Make sure that Server and Network Canvas are on the same network.
    *   Try entering the details for the connection manually. These details (IP address and port number) are available at all times at the top of Server. 
*   If that still does not work, you might have to import the protocol as a local file. This will make case management a little trickier but you will still be able to run your study.

When you click on the server icon, it will initiate a pairing request. Now if you return to server you should see a pop up asking if you want to pair. Click yes and then highlight the 16-character code. Then return to Network Canvas. You can click on the first cell and then paste all 16 characters. It should look something like this: 

In Server: 



<p id="gdcalert41" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/2019-Sunbelt40.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert42">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/2019-Sunbelt40.png "image_tooltip")


Then in Network Canvas: 



<p id="gdcalert42" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/2019-Sunbelt41.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert43">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/2019-Sunbelt41.png "image_tooltip")


Once paired, your protocol will be ready to import. You will see it displayed as one of the options from the paired server. It will look something like this: 



<p id="gdcalert43" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/2019-Sunbelt42.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert44">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/2019-Sunbelt42.png "image_tooltip")



```
Key Concepts: Public Key Encryption, Data Storage and Security  

Network Canvas pairs Server and field devices using a 'key'. This is a 16-character code that is only known by Server and the device with which it is paired. This key is used to encrypt the data using industry-grade encryption, meaning that any data sent between Server and Network Canvas will just look like random unintelligible characters to a third party that does not know the key. 

CODACO (makers of Network Canvas) do not get access to this data nor do we have a means to decrypt any of your data in transit. The point of running your own Server is that you have a secure way to store what can be very sensitive data that does not involve using third parties like Dropbox, Sharepoint, etc...This is important for compliance with many research ethics boards. 

If you want to instead simply deposit the files somewhere and merge them yourself later, then you can sidestep Server entirely and simply export the files after the interview is completed. We think that Server provides many advantages and is secure for transferring protocols and data. However, we also do not think it should be necessary for conducting an interview and receiving the data. 
```



#### Over the lunch break. 

We will want to pair everyone with our Server. In order to do this we will have to exchange keys. The process should look exactly the same as what we just did, except this time you will want to: 



1. Get on the “NC Workshop Wifi” wireless network. This network is not connected to the web but it will create a local network so that Server and Network Canvas can talk to each other.  
2. Check that you can see a Server called “Workshop2019Server”. 
3. DO NOT TRY TO PAIR WITH IT.
    1. The lab instructor will pair with each device individually during the break.

After Lunch

Now that the devices are paired, we want to show you a few features of Network Canvas Server. 

> list of devices; xx.continue(Bernie). 

Once you have a protocol ready to use, it has to be imported into Network Canvas. As we have already seen, the Network Canvas protocol screen allows you to 



*   First part, discuss using server for more complicated remote transfer of data using the classroom protocol as an example. 
*   Second part, discuss offline method of deploying protocol created to network canvas client.


#### Connecting Server and Network Canvas clients



*   We will begin by looking at how to configure Server and Network Canvas clients so that they can communicate, including deploying an interview protocol to clients through Server.
*   We will look at uploading data back to Server.


#### Data export and case management on Server



*   We will demonstrate case management on Server, and the export functionality.
*   Finally, we will discuss alternative deployment and data-management strategies (offline, single machine, etc.)

**Key questions answered in this section: **What is Server? How do I configure Server for my deployment and deploy my interview? Which device should I use to conduct my interview? How do I manage my interview data?


## Session 2 (3 hours)


#### Which hardware should/can I use?



*   pros/cons
*   Platforms
*   Study devices vs authoring devices
*   This section will focus on study logistics, and in particular the use of Server and Network Canvas together to deploy, capture, and securely store interview data. Overall workflow.
*   We will discuss the affordances of different types of interview clients, and how they may impact the interview experience  and the data (touch/keyboard, etc.).


### Providing ongoing effective feedback and collaboration (30 mins)



*   In this final section, we will discuss our needs in terms of ongoing feedback, and encourage community engagement.
*   We will introduce participants to the project feedback portal, and discuss what makes for effective feedback, and which specific areas we are interested in community input on.
*   We will recap the project development timeline, and discuss collaboration options


### Hands on: Implementing workshop participant research instruments (2 hours)



*   This section will invite participants to begin implementing their own measures in Network Canvas, with support from the project team.

**Key questions answered in this section: **How do I implement my own research questions within the Network Canvas suite?


### Feedback session and Q&A (30 mins)



*   We will take the opportunity to solicit feedback on the project from attendees, and discuss specific research problems/questions (potentially also having time to demonstrate solutions).
*   

**Key questions answered in this section: **What makes useful feedback for the project? Which types of feedback are less useful? How do I provide feedback? How can I collaborate?
