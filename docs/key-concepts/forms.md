## Forms

When using Architect to design your study, you will encounter the concept of “forms” in several places. Forms are sections within some interfaces (such as the Ego Form, or the Per Alter Form) that allow you to collect variable values by associating them with an input control. Each form comprises customizable fields to collect attribute data, using appropriate inputs controls based upon the prompt(s) you create. 

Although it may be tempting to use forms as is typical within other more traditional survey software, we encourage researchers to consider the burden of overloaded forms on participants and data quality. For example, while it is possible to capture categorical data within a form, you might elect to use the Categorical Bin interface instead. Making strategic use of forms allows you to capture attribute data systematically, however, you lose the interactive qualities (e.g. dragging and dropping) of other interfaces that may improve the interview experience for participants and potentially render higher quality data.
