# Getting to Know Network Canvas

## Overview

This section explains the various buttons and features of Network Canvas, the interview application. To install Network Canvas, view the [Network Canvas Installation Guide](./installation-guide.md).  

Network Canvas is the main application in the Suite. It is where you, the researcher, collect data with respondents. Network Canvas should be easy for the participants to navigate with little assistance from yourself, but there are still many small issues that can trip up an interview. Being familiar with Network Canvas before going into the field can help ensure that your interview experience is smooth and your data is high quality.
